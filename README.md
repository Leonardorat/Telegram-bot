# Telegram-bot
Simple Telegram bot that shows the XMR price in different currencies. 
Made with Python

1. Create a bot via BotFather
Use @BotFather in Telegram to create a new bot and obtain your API token.

2. Install dependencies

This project uses Python and requires several third-party libraries.

Required packages:

*pyTelegramBotAPI

*requests

You can install them using any Python package manager (e.g., pip).

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment

You can isolate project dependencies using any Python virtual environment tool
(e.g. venv).

5. Add your token from BotFather into:
 ```python
bot = telebot.TeleBot("Bot_API")
```
7. Run the bot
```bash
python main.py
```
You should see:
```bash
file aviable
bot started
```
7. Check your bot
